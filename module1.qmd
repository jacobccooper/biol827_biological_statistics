# Learning objectives:

To reinforce Module 1 learning objectives and gain familiarity with the R statistical framework by using *RStudio* to:

-   Set a working directory

-   Import a dataset

-   Subset dataframes

-   Create and evaluate a frequency histogram

# Before beginning the walkthrough

## Installing *R* and *RStudio*

If you have not already done so, install both of the following free software programs on your computer before beginning the problem set. If you are using a Mac OS, you *may* be prompted to also download and install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) (also free).

-   *R* – behind-the-scenes statistical brain - [download from *R* directly](https://cloud.r-project.org/)

-   *RStudio Desktop* - software we’ll use to run R - [download from Posit](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

On your computer, create a folder dedicated to work done in R and that you will be able to use all semester. Note the file path to this folder, you will need it in this problem set. **Please make sure that this folder is in your UNK OneDrive - this will back up your data in case anything happens, and make it easier to share files with professors and other students.**

-   A *filepath* is like an address your computer uses to organize and find all the information stored on your hard drive. Filepaths are defined within *R* to find where files are stored on your computer. Some filepaths will include `~` which refers to the "base directory" or "default directory" on a machine (for Linux-based operating systems). Examples of filepaths follow for the default `Downloads` folder on a machine:

```{r, eval = F}
# Linux filepath
"~/Downloads/"

# Mac filepath
"~/Downloads/"

# Windows filepath
"C:\\Users\\[YOUR USER NAME]\\Downloads"
```

## Important notes

### Notes on formatting

Throughout these instruction documents, different formats will be used to denote what type of object or data we are talking about. For example, programs like *R* will be italicized, and things related to actual code or coding objects will be formatted `like code`. For example, if a dataset is talking about the number of birds and it has a column called "num_birds", then I will make this clear by formatting it as `num_birds`. If we are talking about the mean of a dataset, I will use "mean", but if I'm talking about the command it will be formatted as "`mean`".

### Tab completing

*RStudio* allows you to do "tab completion". Tab completion is a method that helps prevent you from making mistakes, especially as related to formatting or spelling. For example, if I hit one quote within a coding region in *R*, *RStudio* will automatically complete the quotes and place the cursor in the middle. (This is also true for parentheses, brackets, etc.) Quotes, in *R*, indicates that you will be putting in a filepath. Thus, if I type `"~/Dow"` and hit tab, my computer will autocomplete to `"~/Downloads/"`.

### File naming

It is often common for folks to use spaces in their file names, like `bird data.csv`. However, different coding languages, such as *Bash* and *Python*, see spaces as a break between commands. For example, where *R* might see `bird data.csv` as a single file name, *Bash* would interpret this as perform the command `bird` on the object `data.csv`. Thus, it is *always* better to use underscores or dashes instead, such as `bird_data.csv`.

### Taking notes in *R*

When writing code, it is important to take notes and document each step of what you are doing. In *R*, anything written after a `#` character is ignored. Thus, anything written after a `#` can be used as notes. Compare the following outputs:

```{r}
mean(1:10)
```

```{r}
# mean(1:10)
```

As we can see, the first format returned a value - the mean - whereas the second example did not run. Thus, we can annotate our code like so:

```{r}
# calculate the mean
mean(1:10)
```

If you want to write a lot of notes, enter `#'` before typing notes. Every time you hit `enter`, the next line will start with `#'`.

## Getting help inside *R*

Every function loaded into *R* has a documentation or help page. This is accessible within *R* by typing the function preceded by `?`. For example, if I am not sure what the `mean` function does or how to use it, I would type `?mean`, as shown below:

```{r, eval = F}
?mean
```

This will return a window such as the following in the *bottom right* (plot) pane of *RStudio*. This is the *R* documentation page. You can scroll through to see argument explanations, examples of use, and information on how to cite that particular command.

You can also get citations as follows:

```{r}
citation()
```

# Datasets:

We will be working with two different datasets as part of the *Module 1: Introduction to R* lecture and this *Problem Set Assignment*. These are fictional data associated with hypothetical studies created to illustrate key points. Look at both datasets, available as comma-separated values (`.csv`) files in *Canvas*.

## Dataset 1

A researcher was interested in the relationship between whether more hours in direct sunlight led to more freckles on the back of hands in humans. They found 10 people who volunteered to participate. Each participant (`Subject`) tracked how much sun exposure they had over the course of the summer (`SunExp`). At the end of the summer, they reported the total number of freckles on the backs of both hands (`Freckles`). *Note* that some of these filenames have spaces, as from previous classes; we are working on reformatting filenames to fit the best practices described above.

-   `BIOL827.01 Problem Set Data 1.csv`

## Dataset 2

After analyzing dataset 1, the researcher decided to conduct a follow-up study. This time they found 26 volunteers and asked each volunteer to sit in the sun for a specific number of hours every day for the entire summer. Thirteen participants were assigned to each sun exposure regime (`SunExp`): 1 or 3 hours per day (2 regimes x 13 participants per regime = 36 participants). At the end of the summer, the researcher counted the total number of freckles (`Freckles`) on the backs of both hands of each participant (`Subject`).

-   `BIOL827.01 Problem Set Data 2.csv`

# Procedure:

2.  Download both dataset files (`*.csv`) from *Canvas*. Save them to your *R* folder on your computer.

<!-- -->

3.  Watch *Module 1: Introduction to R* lecture posted on *Canvas*. There is also a Module 1 tutorial video that walks through the procedures below.

## Section A. Set a working directory

The working directory tells *RStudio* where to look for external files and to save files. This eliminates the need to code the entire file path each time a dataset is imported or an *R* file is saved.

4.  Open R, you should have 4 panes.

-   The upper-left pane is the "Source" pane should be blank with ‘`Untitled1`’ at the top. This is where you will enter code.

    -   If you do not have this pane, you can open it by going to: `File > New File > R Script`.

-   The "Console" pane (usually bottom left) is where the code and its associated output will be printed after being Run. (*Running* code is the same as executing the code and having it perform the specified actions).

-   The "Global Environment" pane (usually upper right) lists the objects in *R*’s working memory. Any time you import a dataset or write output to an object, it should be listed here.

-   The "Plots/Viewer" pane (usually bottom right) is where any graphs and help windows will be displayed.

![The four panes that should appear when you first start RStudio. Note that the top left "Source" pane may be missing; see instructions on opening a new file to initiate this pane.](panes.png){fig-align="center"}

5.  In the source pane, type the command `setwd()`.

-   IMPORTANT NOTES:

    -   *R* coding is case sensitive! **Use tab completion!**

    -   Each new command must begin on a new line.

    -   A single command can run onto multiple lines.

```{r, eval = F}
## EXAMPLES
## INCORRECT: two commands on single line
mean(1:10) var(1:10)

## CORRECT: Each command on a line
mean(1:10)
var(1:10)

## CORRECT: One command across multiple lines
mean(1,2,3,4,5,
     6,7,8,9,10)
```

6.  Inside the parentheses, type the file path to your *R* folder in quotation marks.

-   Format of the filepath is operating system dependent. Mac and Linux use `/` to separate portions of the filepath and Windows often uses `\\`. If you are having issues, or two back-slashes (\\\\) in the path. If one doesn’t work, try the other. [If both fail, follow these instructions to create a filepath on your computer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8197027/raw-text-strings-for-file-paths-in-r).

-   R reads a single backslash (`\`) as an "escape" command, so you will receive an error. Escape commands are used frequently in coding languages; for example, `&` may indicate a joining of two objects but `\&` denotes the character "&".

-   **Remember, use Tab Complete! This will put the correct format for you.**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Setting the working directory
# Format is shown for Mac
setwd("~/Documents/BIOL827/")
```

7.  Click "Run", or place your cursor on the line and click `ctrl`+`enter` (Windows / Linux) or `cmd`+`enter` (Mac) to make the line run

-   To run only a portion of the code, highlight that section of code then Run.

8.  We can also save the working directory as an *object*. We can do this as follows:

```{r}
filepath <- "~/Documents/BIOL827/"

filepath
```

-   After running both lines of code, you will see that `filepath` will appear in the top right pane. This is now in our memory! Every time we type the word `filepath` and have it run, it will print out `"~/Documents/BIOL827/"` or whatever the equivalent is on your machine.

9.  See what is in the `filepath` folder. If you have saved both the datasets for this class into that folder, it should look similar to the following:

```{r, eval = F}
list.files(filepath)
```

```         
[1] "BIOL827.01_Problem_Set_Data_1.csv" "BIOL827.01_Problem_Set_Data_2.csv"
```

-   We can see a list of all files at the address designated by `filepath`. Using `filepath` ensures that our code will always work, and that we are not reliant on being in the correct working directory with `setwd`. This will become useful when using `rmarkdown`.

## Section B. Import a dataset

10. First, we need to tell *RStudio* a short name for the dataset we are importing. This is called an object name, such as was shown for `filepath` in step 9.

-   This object name will be used whenever we want *R* to do something with this dataset. Object names can be anything you choose, but should be short, descriptive, and a single string (**no_spaces**) of characters. The object name ***cannot*** begin with a numeral.

    -   I called it object "`Data1`". If you used a different name, be sure to use the name you used in place of `Data1` throughout the instructions.

-   In *R*, a "dataframe" is a set of variables arranged in columns with each unique variable in a single column and information associated with a sample unit in a single row. A `data.frame` is also a very specific object type in *R* that can be passed through to certain commands. The dataset we are importing is considered a `data.frame`.

11. Next, type `<-`. In *R* coding, these characters (`<-`) mean "is created from". I also remember as "put this value into this thing".
12. Now, we need to tell RStudio what data we want to import. Because the data is in a comma-separated values (`*.csv`) format, we need to use the function `read.csv`. Syntax for this code is: `read.csv("filename.csv", header = TRUE)`.

-   R will look in the *working directory* to find the filename indicated. If the working directory has not been set as directed in [Section A. Set a working directory], you will need to include the full filepath with the filename in quotations. There are several ways to do this, as shown below.

-   The option "`header = TRUE`" tells *R* that the first row in the `*.csv` file contains the name for each variable in the dataset.

-   **Don't forget to use tab complete!**

-   Windows computers: If you are using RStudio on a Windows operating system, you may need to include another argument to ensure the \*.csv file is read into *RStudio* correctly: `read.csv("filename.csv", header = TRUE, fileEncoding = "UTF-8-BOM")`

13. Highlight and run the code, or place your cursor on the line and hit `ctrl`+`enter` or `cmd`+`enter`. This code is telling *RStudio* to import data from the indicated `*.csv` file into *RStudio* using the first row of that file to name each variable (= column). *RStudio* will store the data as an object called `Data1`.

-   Whenever we want to do something with this data, we will need to tell *RStudio* to use `Data1`.

```{r}
## Steps 10 through 13 shown here
Data1 <- read.csv("~/Documents/BIOL827/BIOL827.01_Problem_Set_Data_1.csv")

# view first few rows
head(Data1)
```

```{r}
# read the file, but use filepath
# use "paste0" to combine things
# paste0 means "combine, no spaces"
# paste sometimes works with tab complete - not always!

Data1 <- read.csv(paste0(filepath,"BIOL827.01_Problem_Set_Data_1.csv"))

# view first few rows
head(Data1)
```

We can also view what *kind* of data this is in *R*:

```{r}
# str = structure
str(Data1)
```

As mentioned above, *R* has created a `data.frame` with these data with three columns imported: `Subject`, `SunExp`, and `Freckles`.

14. View the imported dataset in *RStudio* by clicking on the object name from the list in the environment panel.

-   This will show the format and specific setup of the object in your *R* environment.

-   Double-clicking this object should open a new tab with a spreadsheet view of the dataset.

## Section C. Subset a dataframe

When working in R, we often want to analyze a subset of observations (= rows) in the `data.frame`. There are many ways to do this, for now we will use the subset() function to create subsets as new objects. The subset function is formatted like so:

`New.dataframe <- subset(dataframe, rows to keep, columns to keep)`

Rows should be identified using criteria specified by a logical argument.

-   The logical argument should tell R which variable contains the criteria and values to keep. See examples in [Section C.2. Subset observations only].

-   If criteria are only given for rows, a comma is not necessary after the criteria.

This will return all variables in the new subset. Variable names must be in quotations and exactly match the spelling and capitalization of the name as given in the dataframe. **Use tab complete when possible, some functions allow for this within the function.**

-   More than one column can be selected using `select=` and the `list` function `c("variable 1", "variable 2")`. `c` stands for "concatenate" to combine things into a single object.

```{r}
# concatenation examples
example_1 <- c("a","b")
example_2 <- c(5,7)

example_1
example_2
```

-   If only subsetting columns and keeping all rows of data, two commas should be between the full `data.frame` name and column variable names so that the row portion of the function is empty. This tells *R* to keep all rows.

#### Anatomy of an *R* command

**There are three basic parts to an *R* command.**

1.  **Object**: set of information (value, variable, dataset, model, etc.) *R* can work with
2.  `<-`: separates the object and function; means "is created from".
3.  **Function**: tells R to do something.

**Command**:

`Data1 <- read.csv("BIOL827.01_Problem_Set_Data_1.csv", header = TRUE)`

**How R reads the command:**

Create a new object called `Data1` by importing the `.csv` file into *R*. Use the first row of the `.csv` file to give a variable name to each column.

### Section C.1. Subset by columns

Create a new dataframe object containing all observations of the sun exposure variable (`SunExp`) only from existing dataframe `Data1`.

15. Begin the command by providing a name of your choosing for the new dataframe to be created by subsetting `Data1`. For example, `SunExp.Data1` since the new variable will contain only the sun exposure variable.
16. On the same line, enter `SunExp.Data1 <- subset(Data1, , "SunExp")`

-   `subset()`: this calls the `subset` function; all arguments related to how we want to subset the dataframe must be made inside these parentheses.

-   `Data1`: this is the name of the existing dataframe with information from which the new `data.frame` will be made.

-   Two commas (with or without a space between): indicates we are not subsetting by rows. That is, all rows of data will be in our new `data.frame`.

-   `SunExp`: this is the name of the variable in `Data1` that we want to copy into the new `data.frame`.

```{r}
# subset data frame
SunExp.Data1 <- subset(Data1, , "SunExp")

# view first few rows
head(SunExp.Data1)
```

Another way to write this for annotation would be:

```{r}
# subset data frame
SunExp.Data1 <- subset(Data1, # data frame
                       , # row filter condition
                       "SunExp") # column filter condition

# view first few rows
head(SunExp.Data1)
```

17. Run the above `subset` command.
18. To view contents of the new `data.frame` in the console panel, highlight or type the new dataframe name and click Run.

-   Quickly and easily highlight a portion of a line by double-clicking on a word. Double clicking will highlight the object or command name only, which you can then run by clicking "Run" or using `ctrl`+`enter` or `cmd`+`enter`.

### Section C.2. Subset observations only

Create a different new `data.frame` from `Data1`. This new `data.frame` should contain all variables but only for participants with 20 or more freckles. Selecting a subset of rows requires a logical statement (*i.e.*, criteria) to let *R* know which rows to copy to the new `data.frame`.

19. Begin the command by providing an object name of your choosing for the new `data.frame`. For example, `Freck20.Data` since we want data from participants with 20 or more freckles in the new `data.frame`.

-   Remember, object names cannot have spaces nor begin with a numeral.

20. Enter the function `<- subset(Data1, Freckles >= 20)` after the object name.

-   `subset()`: this calls the subset function; all arguments related to how we want to subset the `data.frame` must be made inside these parentheses.

-   `Data1`: this is the name of the existing `data.frame` with information from which the new `data.frame` will be made.

-   `Freckles >= 20`: this is a logical argument. It tells *R* to look in variable `Freckles` and copy only rows for which the value of `Freckles` is 20 or greater to the new `data.frame`.

```{r}
# subset by rows
# col argument not needed!
Freck20.Data <- subset(Data1, Freckles >= 20)

Freck20.Data
```

21. Highlight and run the code, as above.
22. To view contents of this new dataframe in the console panel, highlight or type the new `data.frame` name and click Run.

### Section C.3. Subset by both variables and observations

Create a third new dataframe from `Data1`. This new dataframe should contain only the `Subject` and `SunExp` variables and only for participants with 20 or more freckles.

23. Begin the command by providing an object name for the new dataframe.
24. On the same line, enter: `<-subset(Data1, Freckles >= 20, select = c("Subject", "SunExp"))`.

-   `subset()`, `Data1`, and `Freckles >= 20` are the same as described in [Section C.2. Subset observations only].

-   `select = c("Subject","SunExp")`: this uses the list function `c()` to select the two variables, `Subject` and `SunExp`, that we want to copy into the new dataframe. Be sure the variable names are in quotations and spelled in the same case as in the `Data1` dataframe.

25. Highlight and run the command.

```{r}
Freck.var.obs.filter <- subset(Data1, Freckles >= 20,
                               select = c("Subject", "SunExp"))
```

25. To view contents of the new dataframe in the console panel, highlight or type the new dataframe name and click Run.

```{r}
Freck.var.obs.filter
```

27. Compare the dataframes created in [Section C.2. Subset observations only]. and [Section C.3. Subset by both variables and observations]. Notice that the `Freckles` variable is in dataframe `Freck20.Data1` created in [Section C.2. Subset observations only], but not in dataframe `SunExp.Freck20.Data1` created in [Section C.3. Subset by both variables and observations] because it was not included in the select argument in Step 23.

28\. Save your R script file before quitting by clicking the disk icon or by selecting File \> Save from the menu at the top of the screen.

## Section D. Create frequency histograms

Create a frequency histogram for sun exposure and freckle variables from Data1 to evaluate the frequency distribution for each variable. Here, we will use the hist() function and its default settings to get familiar with the structure and content of histograms.

29. Enter the function: `hist(Data1$SunExp)`. This tells *R* to create a histogram from observations of the `SunExp` variable within the `Data1` dataframe.

-   `hist()`: calls the histogram plotting function; all arguments must be made inside these parentheses.

<!-- -->

-   `Data1`: this is the name of the dataframe from which the histogram will be made.

-   `$`: separates an object name from the variable name. The named variable must exist within the named object or you will receive an error from *RStudio*.

-   `SunExp`: identifies the variable in `Data1` to be used for the histogram. A variable with this name must exist within the dataframe identified.

30. Highlight and run the code.

```{r}
hist(Data1$SunExp)
```

31. Repeat step 28 replacing `SunExp` with `Freckles` to create a histogram for the `Freckles` variable within `Data1`.

**Basic operators in *R***

-   `+` add `^` or `**` exponentiation

-   `-` subtract

-   `<` Less than

-   `*` multiply

-   `<=` Less than or equal to

-   `/` divide

-   `>` Greater than

-   `==` equals

-   `>=` Greater than or equal to

-   `!=` does not equal

-   `x|y` `x` or `y` *\*see note below*

-   `!x` is not `x`

-   `x&y` `x` and `y` *\*see note below*

-   `*x|y` and `x&y`: `x` and `y` can represent expressions. For example, `SunExp == 1 & Freckles >= 20` could be used to select only those observations meeting both criteria.

32. Highlight and run the code.
33. Both histograms should now be available in the plots panel (lower right).

-   To navigate between histograms for `Freckles` and `SunExp`, click the arrows at the top of the plots panel.

-   To save graphs as an image file or copy them to paste into a *Canvas* quiz response, click Export (Figure 9, red arrow) and follow the corresponding prompts.

34. Self-assessment. Compare information displayed in each frequency histogram to the raw data for each variable in the Data1 dataframe (or by opening the `.csv` file outside of *RStudio*).

-   Looking at the sun exposure variable in the dataframe, how many values between 0 and 5 does it contain?

-   Now look at the histogram for sun exposure, what frequency is graphed for the 0-5 bin? How does they compare? Hint: they should be the same.
