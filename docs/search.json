    "text": "5.1 Installing R and RStudio\nIf you have not already done so, install both of the following free software programs on your computer before beginning the problem set. If you are using a Mac OS, you may be prompted to also download and install XQuartz (also free).\n\nR – behind-the-scenes statistical brain - download from R directly\nRStudio Desktop - software we’ll use to run R - download from Posit\n\nOn your computer, create a folder dedicated to work done in R and that you will be able to use all semester. Note the file path to this folder, you will need it in this problem set. Please make sure that this folder is in your UNK OneDrive - this will back up your data in case anything happens, and make it easier to share files with professors and other students.\n\nA filepath is like an address your computer uses to organize and find all the information stored on your hard drive. Filepaths are defined within R to find where files are stored on your computer. Some filepaths will include ~ which refers to the “base directory” or “default directory” on a machine (for Linux-based operating systems). Examples of filepaths follow for the default Downloads folder on a machine:\n\n\n# Linux filepath\n\"~/Downloads/\"\n\n# Mac filepath\n\"~/Downloads/\"\n\n# Windows filepath\n\"C:\\\\Users\\\\[YOUR USER NAME]\\\\Downloads\"",

    "section": "5.2 Important notes",
    "text": "5.2 Important notes\n\n5.2.1 Notes on formatting\nThroughout these instruction documents, different formats will be used to denote what type of object or data we are talking about. For example, programs like R will be italicized, and things related to actual code or coding objects will be formatted like code. For example, if a dataset is talking about the number of birds and it has a column called “num_birds”, then I will make this clear by formatting it as num_birds. If we are talking about the mean of a dataset, I will use “mean”, but if I’m talking about the command it will be formatted as “mean”.\n\n\n5.2.2 Tab completing\nRStudio allows you to do “tab completion”. Tab completion is a method that helps prevent you from making mistakes, especially as related to formatting or spelling. For example, if I hit one quote within a coding region in R, RStudio will automatically complete the quotes and place the cursor in the middle. (This is also true for parentheses, brackets, etc.) Quotes, in R, indicates that you will be putting in a filepath. Thus, if I type \"~/Dow\" and hit tab, my computer will autocomplete to \"~/Downloads/\".\n\n\n5.2.3 File naming\nIt is often common for folks to use spaces in their file names, like bird data.csv. However, different coding languages, such as Bash and Python, see spaces as a break between commands. For example, where R might see bird data.csv as a single file name, Bash would interpret this as perform the command bird on the object data.csv. Thus, it is always better to use underscores or dashes instead, such as bird_data.csv.\n\n\n5.2.4 Taking notes in R\nWhen writing code, it is important to take notes and document each step of what you are doing. In R, anything written after a # character is ignored. Thus, anything written after a # can be used as notes. Compare the following outputs:\n\nmean(1:10)\n\n[1] 5.5\n\n\n\n# mean(1:10)\n\nAs we can see, the first format returned a value - the mean - whereas the second example did not run. Thus, we can annotate our code like so:\n\n# calculate the mean\nmean(1:10)\n\n[1] 5.5\n\n\nIf you want to write a lot of notes, enter #' before typing notes. Every time you hit enter, the next line will start with #'.",

This eliminates the need to code the entire file path each time a dataset is imported or an R file is saved.\n\nOpen R, you should have 4 panes.\n\n\nThe upper-left pane is the “Source” pane should be blank with ‘Untitled1’ at the top. This is where you will enter code.\n\nIf you do not have this pane, you can open it by going to: File &gt; New File &gt; R Script.\n\nThe “Console” pane (usually bottom left) is where the code and its associated output will be printed after being Run. (Running code is the same as executing the code and having it perform the specified actions).\nThe “Global Environment” pane (usually upper right) lists the objects in R’s working memory. Any time you import a dataset or write output to an object, it should be listed here.\nThe “Plots/Viewer” pane (usually bottom right) is where any graphs and help windows will be displayed.\n\n\n\n\nThe four panes that should appear when you first start RStudio. Note that the top left “Source” pane may be missing; see instructions on opening a new file to initiate this pane.\n\n\n\nIn the source pane, type the command setwd().\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n\nR coding is case sensitive! Use tab completion!\nEach new command must begin on a new line.\nA single command can run onto multiple lines.\n\n\n\n## EXAMPLES\n## INCORRECT: two commands on single line\nmean(1:10) var(1:10)\n\n## CORRECT: Each command on a line\nmean(1:10)\nvar(1:10)\n\n## CORRECT: One command across multiple lines\nmean(1,2,3,4,5,\n     6,7,8,9,10)\n\n\nInside the parentheses, type the file path to your R folder in quotation marks.\n\n\nFormat of the filepath is operating system dependent. Mac and Linux use / to separate portions of the filepath and Windows often uses \\\\. If you are having issues, or two back-slashes (\\\\) in the path. If one doesn’t work, try the other. If both fail, follow these instructions to create a filepath on your computer.\nR reads a single backslash (\\) as an “escape” command, so you will receive an error. Escape commands are used frequently in coding languages; for example, & may indicate a joining of two objects but \\& denotes the character “&”.\nRemember, use Tab Complete! This will put the correct format for you.\n\n\n# Setting the working directory\n# Format is shown for Mac\nsetwd(\"~/Documents/BIOL827/\")\n\n\nClick “Run”, or place your cursor on the line and click ctrl+enter (Windows / Linux) or cmd+enter (Mac) to make the line run\n\n\nTo run only a portion of the code, highlight that section of code then Run.\n\n\nWe can also save the working directory as an object. We can do this as follows:\n\n\nfilepath &lt;- \"~/Documents/BIOL827/\"\n\nfilepath\n\n[1] \"~/Documents/BIOL827/\"\n\n\n\nAfter running both lines of code, you will see that filepath will appear in the top right pane. This is now in our memory! Every time we type the word filepath and have it run, it will print out \"~/Documents/BIOL827/\" or whatever the equivalent is on your machine.\n\n\nSee what is in the filepath folder. If you have saved both the datasets for this class into that folder, it should look similar to the following:\n\n\nlist.files(filepath)\n\n[1] \"BIOL827.01_Problem_Set_Data_1.csv\" \"BIOL827.01_Problem_Set_Data_2.csv\"\n\nWe can see a list of all files at the address designated by filepath. Using filepath ensures that our code will always work, and that we are not reliant on being in the correct working directory with setwd. This will become useful when using rmarkdown.",

    "text": "7.2 Section B. Import a dataset\n\nFirst, we need to tell RStudio a short name for the dataset we are importing. This is called an object name, such as was shown for filepath in step 9.\n\n\nThis object name will be used whenever we want R to do something with this dataset. Object names can be anything you choose, but should be short, descriptive, and a single string (no_spaces) of characters. The object name cannot begin with a numeral.\n\nI called it object “Data1”. If you used a different name, be sure to use the name you used in place of Data1 throughout the instructions.\n\nIn R, a “dataframe” is a set of variables arranged in columns with each unique variable in a single column and information associated with a sample unit in a single row. A data.frame is also a very specific object type in R that can be passed through to certain commands. The dataset we are importing is considered a data.frame.\n\n\nNext, type &lt;-. In R coding, these characters (&lt;-) mean “is created from”. I also remember as “put this value into this thing”.\nNow, we need to tell RStudio what data we want to import. Because the data is in a comma-separated values (*.csv) format, we need to use the function read.csv. Syntax for this code is: read.csv(\"filename.csv\", header = TRUE).\n\n\nR will look in the working directory to find the filename indicated. If the working directory has not been set as directed in Section A. Set a working directory, you will need to include the full filepath with the filename in quotations. There are several ways to do this, as shown below.\nThe option “header = TRUE” tells R that the first row in the *.csv file contains the name for each variable in the dataset.\nDon’t forget to use tab complete!\nWindows computers: If you are using RStudio on a Windows operating system, you may need to include another argument to ensure the *.csv file is read into RStudio correctly: read.csv(\"filename.csv\", header = TRUE, fileEncoding = \"UTF-8-BOM\")\n\n\nHighlight and run the code, or place your cursor on the line and hit ctrl+enter or cmd+enter. This code is telling RStudio to import data from the indicated *.csv file into RStudio using the first row of that file to name each variable (= column).

    "text": "7.3 Section C. Subset a dataframe\nWhen working in R, we often want to analyze a subset of observations (= rows) in the data.frame. There are many ways to do this, for now we will use the subset() function to create subsets as new objects. The subset function is formatted like so:\nNew.dataframe &lt;- subset(dataframe, rows to keep, columns to keep)\nRows should be identified using criteria specified by a logical argument.\n\nThe logical argument should tell R which variable contains the criteria and values to keep. See examples in Section C.2. Subset observations only.\nIf criteria are only given for rows, a comma is not necessary after the criteria.\n\nThis will return all variables in the new subset. Variable names must be in quotations and exactly match the spelling and capitalization of the name as given in the dataframe. Use tab complete when possible, some functions allow for this within the function.\n\nMore than one column can be selected using select= and the list function c(\"variable 1\", \"variable 2\"). c stands for “concatenate” to combine things into a single object.\n\n\n# concatenation examples\nexample_1 &lt;- c(\"a\",\"b\")\nexample_2 &lt;- c(5,7)\n\nexample_1\n\n[1] \"a\" \"b\"\n\nexample_2\n\n[1] 5 7\n\n\n\nIf only subsetting columns and keeping all rows of data, two commas should be between the full data.frame name and column variable names so that the row portion of the function is empty. This tells R to keep all rows.\n\n\n7.3.0.1 Anatomy of an R command\nThere are three basic parts to an R command.\n\nObject: set of information (value, variable, dataset, model, etc.) R can work with\n&lt;-: separates the object and function; means “is created from”.\nFunction: tells R to do something.\n\nCommand:\nData1 &lt;- read.csv(\"BIOL827.01_Problem_Set_Data_1.csv\", header = TRUE)\nHow R reads the command:\nCreate a new object called Data1 by importing the .csv file into R. Use the first row of the .csv file to give a variable name to each column.\n\n\n7.3.1 Section C.1. Subset by columns\nCreate a new dataframe object containing all observations of the sun exposure variable (SunExp) only from existing dataframe Data1.\n\nBegin the command by providing a name of your choosing for the new dataframe to be created by subsetting Data1. For example, SunExp.Data1 since the new variable will contain only the sun exposure variable.\nOn the same line, enter SunExp.Data1 &lt;- subset(Data1, , \"SunExp\")\n\n\nsubset(): this calls the subset function; all arguments related to how we want to subset the dataframe must be made inside these parentheses.\nData1: this is the name of the existing dataframe with information from which the new data.frame will be made.\nTwo commas (with or without a space between): indicates we are not subsetting by rows. That is, all rows of data will be in our new data.frame.\nSunExp: this is the name of the variable in Data1 that we want to copy into the new data.frame.\n\n\n# subset data frame\nSunExp.Data1 &lt;- subset(Data1, , \"SunExp\")\n\n# view first few rows\nhead(SunExp.Data1)\n\n      SunExp\n1  4.6000000\n2  8.5166667\n3 14.3500000\n4  6.4166667\n5  8.9500000\n6  0.1333333\n\n\nAnother way to write this for annotation would be:\n\n# subset data frame\nSunExp.Data1 &lt;- subset(Data1, # data frame\n                       , # row filter condition\n                       \"SunExp\") # column filter condition\n\n# view first few rows\nhead(SunExp.Data1)\n\n      SunExp\n1  4.6000000\n2  8.5166667\n3 14.3500000\n4  6.4166667\n5  8.9500000\n6  0.1333333\n\n\n\nRun the above subset command.\nTo view contents of the new data.frame in the console panel, highlight or type the new dataframe name and click Run.\n\n\nQuickly and easily highlight a portion of a line by double-clicking on a word. Double clicking will highlight the object or command name only, which you can then run by clicking “Run” or using ctrl+enter or cmd+enter.\n\n\n\n7.3.2 Section C.2. Subset observations only\nCreate a different new data.frame from Data1. This new data.frame should contain all variables but only for participants with 20 or more freckles. Selecting a subset of rows requires a logical statement (i.e., criteria) to let R know which rows to copy to the new data.frame.\n\nBegin the command by providing an object name of your choosing for the new data.frame. For example, Freck20.Data since we want data from participants with 20 or more freckles in the new data.frame.\n\n\nRemember, object names cannot have spaces nor begin with a numeral.\n\n\nEnter the function &lt;- subset(Data1, Freckles &gt;= 20) after the object name.\n\n\nsubset(): this calls the subset function; all arguments related to how we want to subset the data.frame must be made inside these parentheses.\nData1: this is the name of the existing data.frame with information from which the new data.frame will be made.\nFreckles &gt;= 20: this is a logical argument. It tells R to look in variable Freckles and copy only rows for which the value of Freckles is 20 or greater to the new data.frame.\n\n\n# subset by rows\n# col argument not needed!\nFreck20.Data &lt;- subset(Data1, Freckles &gt;= 20)\n\nFreck20.Data\n\n  Subject   SunExp Freckles\n2   Keiko 8.516667       20\n\n\n\nHighlight and run the code, as above.\nTo view contents of this new dataframe in the console panel, highlight or type the new data.frame name and click Run.\n\n\n\n7.3.3 Section C.3. Subset by both variables and observations\nCreate a third new dataframe from Data1. This new dataframe should contain only the Subject and SunExp variables and only for participants with 20 or more freckles.\n\nBegin the command by providing an object name for the new dataframe.\nOn the same line, enter: &lt;-subset(Data1, Freckles &gt;= 20, select = c(\"Subject\", \"SunExp\")).\n\n\nsubset(), Data1, and Freckles &gt;= 20 are the same as described in Section C.2. Subset observations only.\nselect = c(\"Subject\",\"SunExp\"): this uses the list function c() to select the two variables, Subject and SunExp, that we want to copy into the new dataframe. Be sure the variable names are in quotations and spelled in the same case as in the Data1 dataframe.\n\n\nHighlight and run the command.\n\n\nFreck.var.obs.filter &lt;- subset(Data1, Freckles &gt;= 20,\n                               select = c(\"Subject\", \"SunExp\"))\n\n\nTo view contents of the new dataframe in the console panel, highlight or type the new dataframe name and click Run.\n\n\nFreck.var.obs.filter\n\n  Subject   SunExp\n2   Keiko 8.516667\n\n\n\nCompare the dataframes created in Section C.2.

Subset observations only, but not in dataframe SunExp.Freck20.Data1 created in Section C.3.

A variable with this name must exist within the dataframe identified.\n\n\nHighlight and run the code.\n\n\nhist(Data1$SunExp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat step 28 replacing SunExp with Freckles to create a histogram for the Freckles variable within Data1.\n\nBasic operators in R\n\n+ add ^ or ** exponentiation\n- subtract\n&lt; Less than\n* multiply\n&lt;= Less than or equal to\n/ divide\n&gt; Greater than\n== equals\n&gt;= Greater than or equal to\n!= does not equal\nx|y x or y *see note below\n!x is not x\nx&y x and y *see note below\n*x|y and x&y: x and y can represent expressions. For example, SunExp == 1 & Freckles &gt;= 20 could be used to select only those observations meeting both criteria.\n\n\nHighlight and run the code.\nBoth histograms should now be available in the plots panel (lower right).\n\n\nTo navigate between histograms for Freckles and SunExp, click the arrows at the top of the plots panel.\nTo save graphs as an image file or copy them to paste into a Canvas quiz response, click Export (Figure 9, red arrow) and follow the corresponding prompts.\n\n\nSelf-assessment. Compare information displayed in each frequency histogram to the raw data for each variable in the Data1 dataframe (or by opening the .csv file outside of RStudio).\n\n\nLooking at the sun exposure variable in the dataframe, how many values between 0 and 5 does it contain?\nNow look at the histogram for sun exposure, what frequency is graphed for the 0-5 bin? How does they compare? Hint: they should be the same.",
