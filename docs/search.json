Identify best practices for data management, including creation of metadata, to ensure the longevity of datasets. 2. Construct testable hypotheses about biological systems and identify appropriate experimental designs to statistically test those hypotheses. 3. Calculate descriptive statistics to examine the character of a dataset and evaluate statistical power. 4. Conduct and interpret results of standard statistical tests as appropriate for the experimental design used and data collected. 5. Apply statistical concepts in critically evaluating research conducted by others. 6. Communicate research results that are accurately, concisely, and straightforwardly supported by statistics.\nThis site will help you navigate different homework assignments to perform the necessary R tests.\nWelcome to class!\nDr.Â Jacob C.
